<p>A search for <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&amp;q=cast+iron+pan+care">cast iron pan care</a> yields a <em>lot</em> of results. There are as many opinions on how to properly use and take care of cast iron pans as there are people who own cast iron pans.</p>
<p>Here’s what I’ve found works best for me.</p>
<h2 id="seasoning">Seasoning</h2>
<p>When people talk about “seasoning” cast iron, they’re talking about the building up of a solidified (“<em>polymerized</em>”) layer of oil on the surface of the pan. It’s this solid layer that gives the pan <s>magical</s> non-stick properties.</p>
<p>I’ve seen articles <a href="http://sherylcanter.com/wordpress/2010/01/a-science-based-technique-for-seasoning-cast-iron/">like this one</a> advocating the use of flaxseed oil because of its polymerizing properties. It’s expensive though, so I haven’t bothered. I tend to start by just spreading a thin layer of vegetable oil in the pan (like, very thin—pour some oil in and then wipe it out with a paper towel), and baking it in the oven for about an hour at 350F. Repeat as/if needed.</p>
<p>After that, the seasoning will continue to improve over time (with proper care) as you cook in the pan. Use lots of oil when cooking at first—the non-stick properties won’t be perfect yet.</p>
<h2 id="use">Use</h2>
<p>Cast iron is great. Just use it. Just a couple notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you get an empty pan really hot, you’ll notice the seasoning will look sort of dry or splotchy. Just put some oil on it before it cools down.</li>
<li>Try not to cook really acidic things—for example, simmering spaghetti sauce for an extended amount of time. The acid will eat away your seasoning.</li>
<li>Wash it when you’re done with it. Try not to leave crusty food bits sitting in it for days.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="washing">Washing</h2>
<p>My sister got me a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ringer-Original-Stainless-Cleaner-Patented/dp/B00FKBR1ZG?SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&amp;tag=duckduckgo-ffab-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=B00FKBR1ZG">chainmail cast iron scrubber</a> for Christmas a few years ago, and it has made the single biggest difference for my pans. I can’t recommend them enough.</p>
<p>As for the washing, I just throw the pans into my dishwater after I’m done with the rest of the dishes and the water is a little scummy and the soap has mostly broken down.</p>
<p><img src="default/IMG_3508.jpeg?cropResize=800,800" alt="Pan in a sink of disgusting water"></p>
<p>If your pan has developed a good non-stick seasoning, the chainmail scrubber with the dishwater takes any foodbits right off and leaves the seasoning beautifully smooth.</p>
<p>I know the soap is controversial. Most people say to <em>never</em> let soap near your cast iron. I used to subscribe to the no-wash method. I’d just give them a quick wipe after use, and if there were stuck-on foodstuffs, I’d use some salt with a paper towel as a scouring agent. But my pans were always a little gross and I found the results not that great anyway. I think the salt scrub can damage the seasoning.</p>
<h2 id="drying">Drying</h2>
<p>You do want to make sure your pans are totally dry before you put them away or they’ll rust. I used to either throw them in the oven (takes too long) or put them on a burner (if you forget about them you risk scorching the seasoning). Now I dry them by putting them on a burner upside down. They dry quickly and you don’t risk damaging the seasoning.</p>
<p>If they do develop a little surface rust, just scrub it off with a copper scrubber or steel wool. You’ll probably have to re-season afterwards.</p>
<h2 id="restoring">Restoring</h2>
<p>Some day I’ll write about restoring old rusty cast iron. A cast iron pan is never broken, only unloved.</p>
