I made this waxed-canvas tool roll for Dad last Christmas. It's based on a knife roll from the book *Heavy-Duty Sewing* by Anton Sandqvist, with some modifications: particularly an extra layer of canvas to hide the pocket stitching and a different closure.

It was a really fun and easy project---I highly recommend working with some lightweight waxed canvas if you can. It's a joy---it's easy to crease and stays folded once you fold it.

I also made it 100% with things I already had on hand---I didn't buy anything new for it.

Unfortunately I don't have many progress pics or notes on this one.

The only bummer is the only zipper I had on hand was too short, and it turns out this pocket is almost completely unusable.
