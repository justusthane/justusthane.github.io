<h1><a href="/">home</a>/Why does this website exist?</h1>
<p>It's a mild allergic reaction to social media. It’s a place to put things I care about. It's a place to experiment and have fun. It's a place where I don't have to worry about likes or whether one or 100 people are looking at what I'm putting out there. It's in the tradition of putting time into creating a personal website as a creative expression. Remember GeoCities? It's a modern GeoCities site. It's Web 1.0. It's a personal website. The personal website—once abundant and never quite endangered but certainly threatened—is <a href="https://kickscondor.com/hrefhunt">making a comeback</a>. This is my corner of the internet.</p>
<p>It's inspired by <a href="https://grupstrarules.com">grupstrarules.com</a>, the website of a guy I thought was pretty cool in high school, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060908213315/http://www.bobbyburgess.net/journal/?date=20060321">bobbyburgess.net/journal</a>, a blog I used to love. All that remains of Bobby Burgess is what can be found on the Wayback Machine, which isn't much. You got the sense from his blog he had a hard life. I wonder what happened to him.</p>
<p>I also believe it's in your best interest to control your online brand, no matter who you are. You should determine the first result when someone <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=justus+grunow">googles</a> your name, not Facebook or LinkedIn. Don't give up control of your digital identity.</p>
<p>Or maybe your goal is to be anonymous, so you can publish your thoughts or play with ideas without being linked to your real-life identity. That's cool too.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-format-of-the-site">About the format of the site</h2>
<p>The blog format doesn't make a lot of sense for reference materials. If I'm looking for instructions on how to install PHP on Ubuntu, I don't really care when it the article was published relative to the rest of the articles on the site, as long as the information is still relevant.</p>
<p>I would like to know the date it was published on, but it doesn't make sense to have it buried in a flow along with other possibly related or possibly unrelated items—especially on a personal site like this covering disparate subjects (who besides me is likely to care equally about tips on Vim and sewing a canvas bag?).</p>
<p>I'd rather treat each &quot;post&quot; as a sort of living page within its parent category which can be updated and ammended as needed. I feature these categories on the home page for easy access.</p>
<p>I use the <a href="/blog">/blog</a> page as a sort of meta log of content updates in other areas of the site.</p>
