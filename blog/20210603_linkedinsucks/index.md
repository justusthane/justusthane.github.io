I'm no LinkedIn poweruser, but I have used it off-and-on for many years. Today I was surprised to notice that I'm an admin an old employer's LinkedIn page. Not only that, but "my" page has four times the followers and four times the registered employees as the company's official LinkedIn page.

There are about a dozen other admins of the page besides myself, none of whom would have any reason to be. The only thing they have in common is that they are all longtime employees of the company.

How did this happen? I have no idea, but I suspect that Company Pages weren't a feature on LinkedIn back when I first entered in "Memorial Medical Center" as my employer. Sometime later LinkedIn converted it to an actual page and automatically made me an admin.

I've contacted the HR director and offered to turn the page over to him.
