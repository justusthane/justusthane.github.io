  I moved to Canada!

        <p>This is overdue, but I still remember the feelings vividly and want to write it down while I do. This is going to be long and rambling and is mostly written down for my own sake. But I guess if you’re curious about my experience moving to Canada, read on!</p>
<p>In early October of 2020, after months of waiting and uncertainty, my Confirmation of Permanent Residence arrived in Caroline’s mail. With that, I became eligible to start my new life with my wife in Canada. But let’s jump back a year.</p>
<p><em>Queue flashback sound effect</em></p>
<p>Caroline and I were married in September of 2019 and began the visa process in earnest. We worked with an immigration attorney, Jade Calver of <a href="https://www.calverimmigrationservices.com/">Calver &amp; Associates</a>. Jade’s services cost us a little over $5,000 CAD, plus another couple hundred in immigation fees. We probably could have done it on our own, but we consider this money well spent. Jade guided us through the process, made sure everything was done correctly, handled all the communication with the government, and provided reassurance when things were moving slowly.</p>
<p>Along with our marriage certificate, FBI background check, and identification, we were required to submit an abundance of proof of the legitimacy of our relationship, including photos of us together and with family/friends, chat/text message logs, travel history between the US and Canada, and letters of testimonial from family/friends.</p>
<p>On December 30th, 2019, we finally had everything ready and submitted my application for permanet residence to IRCC (Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada). What should have been a two month process ended up taking ten months. The timeline was as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>January 16, 2020: Notified that application was accepted and being processed.</li>
<li>Jan 31, 2020: Requested by IRCC to submit fingerprints. I was able to get this done at the local sheriff’s office, and they were able to submit them electronically.</li>
<li>Feb 3, 2020: Requested by IRCC to submit medical examination within 30 days. This had to be done by an approved physician.</li>
<li>Feb 13, 2020: Had my physical, bloodwork, and chest X-rays done by a walk-in clinic in Thunder Bay. The walk-in clinic did the physical and told me where to go for the bloodwork and X-rays. They then compiled the results and sent them to IRCC. Despite not having Canadian health coverage at this point, the whole thing cost me less than $200.</li>
<li>Feb 29, 2020: After some back-and-forth with the clinic (they’re very busy folks) and some delays receiving the X-rays from the radiologist, the medical examination was finally received by the IRCC.</li>
<li>Mar 20, 2020: IRCC requested a copy of my American passport as well as photos for my permanent resident card within 30 days, which meant that my application was approved!</li>
<li>Mar 31, 2020: Mailed above to IRCC. At this point, amidst COVID ramping up and the Canadian border closing imminently, I had gone to Thunder Bay to stay with Caroline indefinitely (max 6 months under a regular tourist visa) and was working remotely. Because of this, we put Caroline’s address down to mail my documents to when issued, thinking that I might still be there by the time my COPR (Confirmation of Permanent Residence) was mailed.</li>
<li>Apr 2, 2020: Tracking indicated that above had been delivered to IRCC. All that was left at this point was for them to issue my COPR (confirmation of permanent residency), and I would be good to move to Canada! Typical turnaround time is 4 - 6 weeks, but our attorney indicated that with reduced staffing due to COVID it could be longer.</li>
<li>May 4, 2020: Nothing.</li>
<li>May 29, 2020: Nothing. Jade indicated that her other clients weren’t hearing anything either.</li>
<li>June 20, 2020: Received communication from IRCC indicating that they had not received my documents, despite tracking showing that they had arrived beginning of April. Jade wasn’t surprised by this knowing how backlogged they were and advised just waiting for them to sort it out. By this point, I had had to return to the States for unrelated personal reasons.</li>
<li>July 15, 2020: Still nothing. Jade recommended resending my documents, which meant getting my passport photos retaken—not a trivial feat when the nearest location I could get them done was at a Walgreen’s in Duluth, two hours away.</li>
<li>Aug 5, 2020: Received communication requesting confirmation of current mailing address, <strong>indicating that they were ready to mail my COPR</strong>! With the difficulty of getting my passport photos re-done, as well as other personal things going on, I had <em>not</em> resent my paperwork by this point. Jade indicated that I did not need to, since they evidently had received my paperwork after all.</li>
<li>Sep 18, 2020: Nothing since last. Jade said that only some applications were making it through, most were on hold.</li>
<li>Sep 23, 2020: <strong>Received request from IRCC to submit passport copy and photos within 30 days.</strong> This was disheartening, as this was exactly the same request that we originally received from them on March 20th. This indicated that they had lost my submitted documents after all.</li>
<li>Oct 2, 2020: Still hadn’t resent my passport photos. Lots of confusion of how to properly mail it from the States, and lots of back-and-forth with Jade’s colleague (Jade was on parental leave at this point).</li>
<li>ALSO Oct 2, 2020: MY COPR ARRIVED IN THE MAIL AT CAROLINE’S, COMPLETELY OUT OF THE BLUE!! IRCC <em>had</em> received and processed my originally submitted photos, despite indicating that they had not. I was eligible to move to Canada! Along with the COPR came a letter explaining that the COPR was not valid for travel, given that the border was still closed due to COVID, and that I would have to wait to enter Canada and establish residency until I was permitted to cross the border. However, this wasn’t a problem—they were letting spouses of Canadians cross the border, so I was still able to enter. With the uncertainty of COVID, and knowing that could change without warning at any time, I wanted to cross the border as soon as possible. I notified my employer that I would be moving to Canada and working remotely and gave notice on my apartment.</li>
</ul>
<p>And this brings us to the month of my move. There were a ton of logistics to deal with in October, including making a trip south to visit my parent, selling my car, packing up, figuring out import of my motorcycles and firearms (and house plants!), renting a uHaul, etc. I took the last four days before my scheduled move off work to finish packing and cleaning, but even so, it was an insanely stressful four days. I felt close to nervous breakdown at times, not thinking I was going to have everything ready to go in time.</p>
<p><img src="IMG_6250.jpeg" alt=""><br>

<p><img src="IMG_6300.jpeg" alt=""><br>
<em>Last visit with Marika, Biagio, and Lily</em></p>
<p><img src="IMG_6322.jpeg" alt=""><br>
<em>T-2 days. This is when the stress got real.</em></p>
<p><img src="IMG_6325.jpeg" alt=""><br>
<em>Boxes of plants. Fun facts: you’re allowed to bring up to 50 houseplants across the border with you; you must personally accompany them across the border; and they must not be plants that are able to live year-round in Canada. I may have cheated slightly on the last point, but they didn’t check.</em></p>
<p><img src="IMG_6330.jpeg" alt=""><br>
<em>This is a big fucking truck. Banana for scale.</em></p>
<p><img src="IMG_6333.jpeg" alt=""><br>
<em>Having sold my car, did some final errands on my bike in a blizzard. Could see very little once my helmet visor was covered with snow—would not recommend.</em></p>
<p><img src="IMG_6349.jpeg" alt=""><br>
<em>Tawny being exceedingly good and patient on the final, and most stressful, day.</em></p>
<p><img src="IMG_6351.jpeg" alt=""><br>
<em>Finally in the truck!</em></p>
<p><img src="IMG_6353.jpeg" alt=""><br>
<em>At the border!</em></p>
<p><img src="IMG_6365.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>But I did, and on October 29th I loaded the last of my stuff and our sweet elderly blind doggo Tawny into the 26’ uHaul, made one last stop at the dump, and got on the highway north.</p>
<p>The 45 minutes between Grand Marais and the border were excruciatingly exciting and nervewracking. Everything was in order, the entirety of my belongings were itemized on a printed spreadsheet, and my wife was waiting at the border with my documents. On the other hand, all of my belongings were packed into a uHaul, I had moved out of my apartment, and there’s no law that says they <em>have</em> to let me in—especially with COVID. They could turn me away if they wanted to, and what would I do then?</p>
<p>Everyone at the border was so friendly, my wife was there, they were so impressed with my inventory of belongings that they didn’t even bother looking in the uHaul, and the border guard shook my hand when he welcomed me to Canada—just like a movie.</p>
<p>In the subsequent months, I’ve moved twice, landed my ideal job, got my Ontario driver’s license, health card, and permanet resident card. As I’m writing this five months later, the border is still closed, COVID is still not under control here (but I get my first vaccination in nine days!), Caroline is living 600 miles away until she finishes her contract in November, and I haven’t crossed back into the States or seen my family or friends since moving, but I am still so excited and feel so fortunate to finally be here.</p>
<p>O Canada!</p>

        <p>Once I start trying to solve a problem in a particular way, I find it very difficult to give up and look for an alternative approach—even though the alternative approach often ends up being much simpler.</p>
<p>I have an html file containing the lyrics to Radiohead’s <em>Fitter Happier</em>:</p>
<pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html">Fitter, happier, more productive<br>Comfortable (not drinking too much)<br>Regular exercise at the gym (3 days a week)<br>Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries<br>At ease<br>Eating well (no more microwave dinners and saturated fats)<br>A patient, better driver<br>A safer car (baby smiling in back seat)<br>Sleeping well (no bad dreams)</code></pre>

<p>…and so on (let’s not worry about <em>why</em> right now). Of course this would be a pain in the ass to do manually, but I knew Vim would help me out.</p>
<p>It was clear upfront that a one-size-fits-all RegEx wouldn’t do the trick here, since some of the links need to be a single word, while some are a phrase, and there’s no obvious pattern—I need to decide for each one what I want the link to consist of.</p>
<p>My first approach, and the one that I got stuck on, was trying to use a visual selection in a search &amp; replace expression. I figured that I could select a word or phrase, and then run a search &amp; replace within that visual selection, replacing the selection with the appropriate HTML for a link to the selection. In Regular Expression terms, I’d be looking for <code>(.*)</code> within the selection (in other words, the entire selection), and replacing it with <code>&lt;a href=&quot;https://google.com/search\?q=$1&amp;btnI&quot;&gt;$1&lt;/a&gt;</code></p>
<p>I tried to make this work for almost two hours—the issue was that I couldn’t get Vim to save the entire visual selection to a single capture group, no matter what I tried. There’s probably a way to do it, but I don’t know it. Finally, it occured to me that macros would probably provide a solution. Macros allow you to record and reply a set of keystrokes. By this point I was frustrated and ready for a break, so I took Tawny for a walk, and while walking the (easy) solution came to me:</p>
<pre class="language-vim"><code class="language-vim">v2e <span class="token comment">" Make any visual selection---in this case, we're selecting the next two words</span><br><span class="token keyword">qa</span> <span class="token comment">" Begin recording a macro to register A</span><br><span class="token string">"zc "</span> Yank the <span class="token builtin">selection</span> <span class="token keyword">to</span> the Z register<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token keyword">delete</span> it<span class="token punctuation">,</span> and switch <span class="token keyword">to</span> Insert <span class="token keyword">mode</span><br><span class="token operator">&lt;</span>a href<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"https://google.com/search?q= "</span> Start typing our replacement string<br>^rz <span class="token comment">" Paste the contents of the Z buffer without leaving Insert mode</span><br>&amp;btnI<span class="token string">"> "</span> Continue typing our replacement string<br>^rz <span class="token comment">" Again paste the contents of the Z buffer</span><br><span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token operator">/</span>a<span class="token operator">></span> <span class="token comment">" Finish typing our replacement string</span><br><span class="token operator">&lt;</span>esc<span class="token operator">></span> <span class="token comment">" Leave Insert mode</span><br><span class="token keyword">q</span> <span class="token comment">" Stop recording our buffer</span></code></pre>
<p>Now that we have our macro built, all we have to do to make the rest of the changes is select a word or phrase we want to “linkify”, and execute our macro with <code>@a</code></p>
<p>Here’s the magic in action:</p>
<script id="asciicast-xOq4vvQ1ze66wWIYgOqNsaXHP" src="https://asciinema.org/a/xOq4vvQ1ze66wWIYgOqNsaXHP.js" async></script>

      <div class="content ">
        <p>An interesting article outlining a theory about how primordial black holes created shortly after the big bang could account for the “missing matter” that we’ve been attributing to dark matter. Apparently this is a theory originally pioneered by Stephen Hawking, but fell out of favor when no one was able to observe all these black holes that should be floating around out there.</p>
<p>More recently, the LIGO should be detecting far more black hole colisions if space is full of these primordial black holes.</p>
<p>However, this new theory postulates that the black holes would have formed in clusters of up to a thousand black holes crammed together, with huge black holes at the center, and tiny asteroid-sized black holes around the edge. The clusters explain why we haven’t observed these primordial black holes yet, and their orbits keep them from colliding often and explain the low collision rates seen my LIGO.</p>
<p>Apparently if we’re able to observe one of these asteroid-sized black holes it would be a huge step forward for this primordial black hole theory, as black holes that small can’t be formed by collapsing stars.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting, easy to read article, plus it has these absolutely gorgeous illustrations:</p>
<p><img src="SpacePuff_Spot_01_400.jpg" alt="black holes"></p>
<p>I also found <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24576882">this related discussion</a> on Hacker News about what might happen (or not happen) if one of these asteroid-sized black holes colided with earth very interesting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An asteroid-mass black hole would be too small to interact much. It would go straight through the planet, and couldn’t possibly capture enough mass to be e.g. captured, but it would register as something like a very high energy cosmic ray.</p>

        <p>I was walking Tawny just a couple blocks from home when we discovered a network of trails through a wooded area that I previously had no idea about. The wooded area is only about a block and a half wide by maybe three blocks long, but it’s a secret little wilderness. This is the sort of thing only discovered on meandering walks.</p>

        <p>First I added my pixel art avatar to the top of this site. Then I decided it would be fun if the eyes moved, so I created three new versions of the image, with the eyes looking left, right, and down, and wrote some Javascript to swap the images depending on the cursor location. Then I thought I’d give it some more personality by having it blink randomly, so I created another version of the image with the eyes closed, and wrote a function that, every 0 - 15 seconds, swaps the image with the eyes-closed version, waits 150 miliseconds, and swaps it back.</p>
<p>It works really nicely. Sometimes it will go along time between blinks and you can have a staring contest. Sometimes it blinks twice in quick succession.</p>
<p>But through some quirk in the code that I don’t understand, if you don’t interact with the site for a while it defaults to the eyes-closed state, and the eyes stay closed until you interact again. It sleeps. I don’t understand how this happens—the function is written so after 150 miliseconds, the eyes should reopen. I don’t understand it, and I love it.</p>

        <p>It’s been bothering me for a while that the pages on this site were sorted by the date created rather than the date updated (if there was one), so that the first created pages are always at the bottom of the list regardless of how recently they were updated. I want fresh stuff at the top! The only date that Eleventy provides out of the box is the date created—there is no concept of date modified by default. I had created a “modified” value in the YAML frontmatter for each page for display purposes, but there wasn’t a way to sort by those dates…until now!</p>
<p>It required creating a custom Eleventy filter that takes the supplied array of pages and sorts them by my “date modified” value, and I’m super proud of myself for getting there. It’s pretty basic stuff, but it felt good to figure it out.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/justusthane/justusthane.github.io/commit/0e68643daeaef6b5a6b2dd00463eb30f33b33ee8">Here’s the commit</a>.</p>
<p>It’s cool how easy it was to make this happen (my lack of Javascript chops notwithstanding). I feel like a superhero every time I add a filter to introduce new functionality to my site. <a href="https://11ty.dev">Eleventy</a> rocks!</p>

        <p>Fittingly brief piece on our decreasing attention spans in this tweetable era. Krish’s thesis is that the problem can’t be solved from a capitalist perspective because companies sell what people want, so instead of trying to solve it we should adapt to it, be prepared for it, and think about how our thinking and communication will be changed in the long term.</p>
<p>Krish suggests that while our intra-personal communication will become decreasingly verbose, it may also become increasingly efficient, until we no longer need to use words and can communicate sensations directly, and that this could have beneficial implications for equality and education, as communication/language barriers will cease to be barriers to understanding.</p>
<p>There’s a cameo from Kanye in the article, who has an interesting take. Awesome:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think people are going to talk in the future…They’re going to communicate through eye contact, body language, emojis, signs. Imagine that. If everyone was forced to learn sign language. <sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSGtNK9YawA">Source</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s an interesting take, but I feel it’s rather optimistic about the outcome of decreasing attention spans. I think if we lose our ability to focus for longer than the length of a tweet we won’t possibly be capable of implementing the required drastic changes to adapt to what we’re talking about.</p>
<p>I’m also less <em>pessimistic</em>, in a way: I don’t think this is an inevitability. While it’s true that attention spans are surely decreasing, I think people recognize it as a problem in themselves and will strive to overcome.</p>

        <p>Hey, wow, I’m honored! And I hope you appreciate that on my <a href="/links">Links</a> page I literally just have the word “Kickscondor” because I was too lazy to turn it into a link. Heck, I was even too lazy to just type a space. And today I told a friend about your site, but I just scribbled “Kicks Condor” on a scap of paper and handed it to him. That’s gotta be worth something, right?</p>
<p>Hey, maybe that’s the answer. Maybe we need to take the <em>h</em> out of <em>href</em>. Maybe we need to take the <em>hyper</em> out of <em>hyperlink</em>. If someone really cares, they’ll have to manually type the words into their search engine. That’ll stop those link cowboys!</p>
<p>Incidentally, I’m pretty sure I can handle at least 20 links before certain destruction—so feel free to keep on linking.</p>

        <p>I was thinking about how personal assistants—Siri, et al.—have almost exlusively female voices by default. I’m sure it’s because in general people tend to be less threatened by women and so are more likely to be comfortable with a woman’s voice living in their pocket. Isn’t that a little sexist though? Anyway, I changed my Siri’s voice to a male’s a few weeks ago, and my life is still fine.</p>
