<p>This blog serves mostly as a sort of “meta log” to list updates I’ve made elsewhere on the site, with some interspersed thoughts. If you’re curious about what I’ve added since your last visit, this is the place to check.</p>

</h2></div>
      <div class="publish-date">Published <a href="/blog/20200924_black-holes/" class="dt-published u-url u-uid"><i class="fa fa-link"></i>2020-09-24</a></div>
      <div class="content ">
        <p>An interesting article outlining a theory about how primordial black holes created shortly after the big bang could account for the “missing matter” that we’ve been attributing to dark matter. Apparently this is a theory originally pioneered by Stephen Hawking, but fell out of favor when no one was able to observe all these black holes that should be floating around out there.</p>
<p>More recently, the LIGO should be detecting far more black hole colisions if space is full of these primordial black holes.</p>
<p>However, this new theory postulates that the black holes would have formed in clusters of up to a thousand black holes crammed together, with huge black holes at the center, and tiny asteroid-sized black holes around the edge. The clusters explain why we haven’t observed these primordial black holes yet, and their orbits keep them from colliding often and explain the low collision rates seen my LIGO.</p>
<p>Apparently if we’re able to observe one of these asteroid-sized black holes it would be a huge step forward for this primordial black hole theory, as black holes that small can’t be formed by collapsing stars.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting, easy to read article, plus it has these absolutely gorgeous illustrations:</p>
<p><img src="SpacePuff_Spot_01_400.jpg" alt="black holes"></p>
<p>I also found <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24576882">this related discussion</a> on Hacker News about what might happen (or not happen) if one of these asteroid-sized black holes colided with earth very interesting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An asteroid-mass black hole would be too small to interact much. It would go straight through the planet, and couldn’t possibly capture enough mass to be e.g. captured, but it would register as something like a very high energy cosmic ray.</p>

        <p>I was walking Tawny just a couple blocks from home when we discovered a network of trails through a wooded area that I previously had no idea about. The wooded area is only about a block and a half wide by maybe three blocks long, but it’s a secret little wilderness. This is the sort of thing only discovered on meandering walks.</p>

  Unexpected behavior

        <p>First I added my pixel art avatar to the top of this site. Then I decided it would be fun if the eyes moved, so I created three new versions of the image, with the eyes looking left, right, and down, and wrote some Javascript to swap the images depending on the cursor location. Then I thought I’d give it some more personality by having it blink randomly, so I created another version of the image with the eyes closed, and wrote a function that, every 0 - 15 seconds, swaps the image with the eyes-closed version, waits 150 miliseconds, and swaps it back.</p>
<p>It works really nicely. Sometimes it will go along time between blinks and you can have a staring contest. Sometimes it blinks twice in quick succession.</p>
<p>But through some quirk in the code that I don’t understand, if you don’t interact with the site for a while it defaults to the eyes-closed state, and the eyes stay closed until you interact again. It sleeps. I don’t understand how this happens—the function is written so after 150 miliseconds, the eyes should reopen. I don’t understand it, and I love it.</p>

  Sort pages by date updated

      <div class="content ">
        <p>It’s been bothering me for a while that the pages on this site were sorted by the date created rather than the date updated (if there was one), so that the first created pages are always at the bottom of the list regardless of how recently they were updated. I want fresh stuff at the top! The only date that Eleventy provides out of the box is the date created—there is no concept of date modified by default. I had created a “modified” value in the YAML frontmatter for each page for display purposes, but there wasn’t a way to sort by those dates…until now!</p>
<p>It required creating a custom Eleventy filter that takes the supplied array of pages and sorts them by my “date modified” value, and I’m super proud of myself for getting there. It’s pretty basic stuff, but it felt good to figure it out.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/justusthane/justusthane.github.io/commit/0e68643daeaef6b5a6b2dd00463eb30f33b33ee8">Here’s the commit</a>.</p>
<p>It’s cool how easy it was to make this happen (my lack of Javascript chops notwithstanding). I feel like a superhero every time I add a filter to introduce new functionality to my site. <a href="https://11ty.dev">Eleventy</a> rocks!</p>

      <div class="content ">
        <p>Fittingly brief piece on our decreasing attention spans in this tweetable era. Krish’s thesis is that the problem can’t be solved from a capitalist perspective because companies sell what people want, so instead of trying to solve it we should adapt to it, be prepared for it, and think about how our thinking and communication will be changed in the long term.</p>
<p>Krish suggests that while our intra-personal communication will become decreasingly verbose, it may also become increasingly efficient, until we no longer need to use words and can communicate sensations directly, and that this could have beneficial implications for equality and education, as communication/language barriers will cease to be barriers to understanding.</p>
<p>There’s a cameo from Kanye in the article, who has an interesting take. Awesome:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think people are going to talk in the future…They’re going to communicate through eye contact, body language, emojis, signs. Imagine that. If everyone was forced to learn sign language. <sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSGtNK9YawA">Source</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s an interesting take, but I feel it’s rather optimistic about the outcome of decreasing attention spans. I think if we lose our ability to focus for longer than the length of a tweet we won’t possibly be capable of implementing the required drastic changes to adapt to what we’re talking about.</p>
<p>I’m also less <em>pessimistic</em>, in a way: I don’t think this is an inevitability. While it’s true that attention spans are surely decreasing, I think people recognize it as a problem in themselves and will strive to overcome.</p>

That’s gotta be worth something, right?</p>
<p>Hey, maybe that’s the answer. Maybe we need to take the <em>h</em> out of <em>href</em>. Maybe we need to take the <em>hyper</em> out of <em>hyperlink</em>. If someone really cares, they’ll have to manually type the words into their search engine. That’ll stop those link cowboys!</p>

        <p>I’m spending a lot of time and having a lot of fun building this site, but I’m a little bit concerned about whether I’ll actually make content to populate it. But maybe the more excited about the site I am, the more likely I’ll be to make content for it?</p>
<p><em>Edit</em>: Or maybe half of the value is just in the building of it anyway.</p>

        <p>I was thinking about how personal assistants—Siri, et al.—have almost exlusively female voices by default. I’m sure it’s because in general people tend to be less threatened by women and so are more likely to be comfortable with a woman’s voice living in their pocket. Isn’t that a little sexist though? Anyway, I changed my Siri’s voice to a male’s a few weeks ago, and my life is still fine.</p>
