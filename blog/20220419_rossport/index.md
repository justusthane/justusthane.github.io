Caroline and I took a mini vacation to Rossport, two hours east of here, this past weekend.  With Caroline being in the process of growing a tiny human and all, she was looking for a pretty relaxed weekend. That works for me, since she usually wants to do more than I do and I'm pretty content to lounge around.

We arrived Thursday night and settled into this wonderful and funky little room at [Serendipity Gardens](http://www.serendipitygardens.ca/) Guest House:

Rossport is tiny, so despite the guest houses being on the "outskirts", it's about a two-minute walk to "downtown" and the marina. 

On Friday we followed a little trail from the guest houses that the proprietor had told us about. After a very short hike, it lead us to the lovely Little Lake nestled in the woods. At first we thought the trail ended at the lake, but keen-eyed Caroline spotted pink flagging tape marking a trail clockwise around the lake.

After about a kilometer (which took us 40 min---the snow was DEEP, and even with snowshoes we were constantly breaking through to knee-depth) we reached a little overlook where the trail seemed to end. We stopped and picnicked, and then turned around.

After getting back to where we started, keen-eyed Caroline spotted another trail, this one going the opposite direction around the lake. We followed that one a ways until it again seemed to end, and turned back.

Looking at our GPS track afterwards, we realized that we had *almost* circumnavigated the lake afterall, and the two trails probably did connect.

Oh well! All in all, it was a lovely little snowshoe on a beautiful day.

In the afternoon, we took a walk through town and followed the road onto Nicol Island---a picturesque little island with vacation houses and nice views of the lake and surrounding islands.

For dinner we had leftover orange sweet potato soup with spicy cumin granola and assembled a smoked salmon salad:

Both delicious.

On Saturday, we went for a run through town. Caroline wanted to get 12 miles in as training for our upcoming half-marathon, but considering Rossport is basically consists of a single street along the water and a short spur road onto the aforementioned Nicol Island, it ended up being three out-and-backs from the hotel to the end of the island.

I bailed after the first two laps as my hip has been bothering me, but Charlee stayed with Caroline the whole time---his longest run yet!
