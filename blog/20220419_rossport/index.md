Caroline and I took a mini vacation to Rossport, two hours east of here, this past weekend.  With Caroline being in the process of growing a tiny human and all, she was looking for a pretty relaxed weekend. That works for me, since she usually wants to do more than I do and I'm pretty content to lounge around.

We arrived Thursday night and settled into this wonderful and funky little room at [Serendipity Gardens](http://www.serendipitygardens.ca/) Guest House:

Rossport is tiny, so despite the guest houses being on the "outskirts", it's about a two-minute walk to "downtown" and the marina. 

On Friday we followed a little trail from the guest houses that the proprietor had told us about. After a very short hike, it lead us to the lovely Little Lake nestled in the woods. At first we thought the trail ended at the lake, but keen-eyed Caroline spotted pink flagging tape marking a trail clockwise around the lake.

After about a kilometer (which took us 40 min---the snow was DEEP, and even with snowshoes we were constantly breaking through to knee-depth) we reached a little overlook where the trail seemed to end. We stopped and picnicked, and then turned around.

For dinner we had leftover orange sweet potato soup with spicy cumin granola and assembled a smoked salmon salad:

Both delicious.
