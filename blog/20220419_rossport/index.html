  Mini vacay to Rossport

  </h1>

<p class="publish-date">Published 2022-04-19, updated 2022-04-19</p>
<p>Caroline and I took a mini vacation to Rossport, two hours east of here, this past weekend.  With Caroline being in the process of growing a tiny human and all, she was looking for a pretty relaxed weekend. That works for me, since she usually wants to do more than I do and I’m pretty content to lounge around.</p>
<p>We arrived Thursday night and settled into this wonderful and funky little room at <a href="http://www.serendipitygardens.ca/">Serendipity Gardens</a> Guest House:</p>

<p>Rossport is tiny, so despite the guest houses being on the “outskirts”, it’s about a two-minute walk to “downtown” and the marina.</p>
<p>On Friday we followed a little trail from the guest houses that the proprietor had told us about. After a very short hike, it lead us to the lovely Little Lake nestled in the woods. At first we thought the trail ended at the lake, but keen-eyed Caroline spotted pink flagging tape marking a trail clockwise around the lake.</p>
<p><img src="2204_untitled_889.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>After about a kilometer (which took us 40 min—the snow was DEEP, and even with snowshoes we were constantly breaking through to knee-depth) we reached a little overlook where the trail seemed to end. We stopped and picnicked, and then turned around.</p>
<p><img src="IMG_1206.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>After getting back to where we started, keen-eyed Caroline spotted another trail, this one going the opposite direction around the lake. We followed that one a ways until it again seemed to end, and turned back.</p>
<p>Looking at our GPS track afterwards, we realized that we had <em>almost</em> circumnavigated the lake afterall, and the two trails probably did connect.</p>
<p><img src="IMG_1247.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Oh well! All in all, it was a lovely little snowshoe on a beautiful day.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we took a walk through town and followed the road onto Nicol Island—a picturesque little island with vacation houses and nice views of the lake and surrounding islands.</p>

<p>For dinner we had leftover orange sweet potato soup with spicy cumin granola and assembled a smoked salmon salad:</p>
<p><img src="IMG_1207.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Both delicious.</p>
<p>Saturday morning, we went for a run through town. Caroline wanted to get 12 miles in as training for our upcoming half-marathon, but considering Rossport is basically consists of a single street along the water and a short spur road onto the aforementioned Nicol Island, it ended up being three out-and-backs from the hotel to the end of the island.</p>

<p>I bailed after the first two laps as my hip has been bothering me, but Charlee stayed with Caroline the whole time—his longest run yet!</p>
<p>After lunch, we drove to Terrace Bay, about 30 min further east, to check out Aguasabon falls.</p>
<p><img src="2204_untitled_1077.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We also visited the town beach, where we learned (and maybe Charlee learned) that Charlee is afraid of waves:</p>
<p><img src="2204_untitled_1083.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Caroline tried demonstrating that waves aren’t scary:</p>
<p><img src="2204_untitled_1111.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>On the road to the beach we also discovered this really wild and rundown old building:</p>
<p><img src="2204_untitled_1175.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="2204_untitled_1159.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I’d love to know what this building was. Terrace Bay was established as a company town in the 40s for a paper mill so there would have been lots of worker housing, but I can’t imagine the company would put that much effort and creativity into a building like this just for housing workers. Perhaps some enterprising entrepreneur thought Terrace Bay would be a hot tourist destination and built it as a hotel?</p>
