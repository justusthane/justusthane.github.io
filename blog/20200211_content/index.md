I'm spending a lot of time and having a lot of fun building this site, but I'm a little bit concerned about whether I'll actually make content to populate it. But maybe the more excited about the site I am, the more likely I'll be to make content for it?

*Edit*: Or maybe half of the value is just in the building of it anyway.
