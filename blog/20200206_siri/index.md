I was thinking about how personal assistants&mdash;Siri, et al.&mdash;have almost exlusively female voices by default. I'm sure it's because in general people tend to be less threatened by women and so are more likely to be comfortable with a woman's voice living in their pocket. Isn't that a little sexist though? Anyway, I changed my Siri's voice to a male's a few weeks ago, and my life is still fine.
