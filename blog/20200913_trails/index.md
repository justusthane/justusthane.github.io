I was walking Tawny just a couple blocks from home when we discovered a network of trails through a wooded area that I previously had no idea about. The wooded area is only about a block and a half wide by maybe three blocks long, but it's a secret little wilderness. This is the sort of thing only discovered on meandering walks.
