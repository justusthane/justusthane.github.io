Today's my birthday! I turned 32. A few neat things that happened today, completely unrelated to it being my birthday:

- I got a new work key I've been waiting on
- I was given this Monday off, so I can spend an extra day with Caroline in Temiskaming this weekend
- My doctor's office coincidentally called to reschedule an appointment that I was supposed to have on Monday
- Biagio got himself an Aerostich Roadcrafter for 50% off
- I was able to reschedule my second vaccination from September 28 to July 15th, meaning I should be able to go to Marika and Biagio's wedding party!
