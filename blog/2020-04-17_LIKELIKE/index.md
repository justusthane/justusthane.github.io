This is an amazing multiplayer virtual museum, complete with different interactive exhibits in the form of rooms. There's a rhyme room where you can only say things that rhyme with what's already been said. There's a mirror room. There's a censorship room where each word can only be said once. I did manage to say my name in the censorship room though.
