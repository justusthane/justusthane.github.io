Amazing, chaotic, glorious online multiplayer remake of the old classic Joust arcade game in which jousting knights riding flying ostriches attempt to knock each other off. 

![](joust.png)

Left/right arrows to move, `space` or `w` repeatedly to fly. When you collide with another knight, you'll kill them if you are higher than they are.

There are three teams, the scores of which are shown at the top. Press `tab` to show the leaderboard. `T` switches teams.

Turn your volume down before starting!
