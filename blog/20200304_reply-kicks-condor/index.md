Hey, wow, I'm honored! And I hope you appreciate that on my [Links](/links) page I literally just have the word "Kickscondor" because I was too lazy to turn it into a link. Heck, I was even too lazy to just type a space. And today I told a friend about your site, but I just scribbled "Kicks Condor" on a scap of paper and handed it to him. That's gotta be worth something, right?

Hey, maybe that's the answer. Maybe we need to take the *h* out of *href*. Maybe we need to take the *hyper* out of *hyperlink*. If someone really cares, they'll have to manually type the words into their search engine. That'll stop those link cowboys!

Incidentally, I'm pretty sure I can handle at least 20 links before certain destructionâ€”so feel free to keep on linking.
