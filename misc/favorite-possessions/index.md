A few of my very favorite physical possessions, in no particular order.

## Hand-knit slipper socks

Slipper socks knitted for me by my wife's grandma (thanks Lynn :)). I wear them over a pair of wool socks and they're the coziest thing ever.

## Bamboo spatula

The humble bamboo spatula is one of my most used kitchen utensils. It mixes, it stirs, it scrapes, it serves.

## Alpine Swiss front wallet

This $12 leather front wallet, purchased from Amazon in 2015. It's held up fantastically---the leather has aged well, and not a stitch has broken.
