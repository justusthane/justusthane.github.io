"this notebook is probably the most important artifact to who I am, it's been at my side, helping me observe and process multiple life events, ups and downs, lefts and rights, multiple loop the loops too. It holds thoughts and homework and ideas and love and doodles from friends. Sometimes it acts as a guestbook."
