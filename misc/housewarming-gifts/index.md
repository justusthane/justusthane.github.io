In September 2020 I took the [*Internet Homesteading*](https://hyperlink.academy/courses/internet-homesteading/22) course at [Hyperlink Academy](https://hyperlink.academy). It was a great time spent creating with other folks interested in personal websites.

At the end of the course our facilitator Jared proposed a lovely final exercise of giving each other digital housewarming gifts for our spaces on the web.

I asked people to send me a photo of one of their favorite posessions along with a writeup of why it's important to them. These are the gifts I received.

I'd love to collect more! If you would like to give me a housewarming gift, just [email me](mailto:jg@justus.ws) a photo of a favorite possession, a description of why it's meaningful, and your website (if you want it linked).
