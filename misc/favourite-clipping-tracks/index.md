I've been quite enjoying the experimental Hip Hop group *clipping.* for a while now. Also classified as *noise core*, they can be a bit difficult to get into, but I think it's worth it to give them a shot.

> I'm not a *Hamilton* guy so I didn't realize this until recently, but *clipping.*'s rapper, Daveed Diggs, played Marquis de Lafayette and Thomas Jefferson in the original production.

The first song I got into was *The Deep*, so I'll start there. It's also a pretty approachable one. I was going to summarize the story it tells, but I'll just quote the beginning of the track instead:

> Our mothers were pregnant African women thrown overboard while crossing the Atlantic Ocean on slave ships. 
> We were born breathing water as we did in the womb. 
> We built our home on the sea floor, unaware of the two-legged surface dwellers until their world came to destroy ours. 
> With cannons, they searched for oil beneath our cities. Their greed and recklessness forced our uprising.

That's right --- afrofuturism meets mermaids. Excellent, right?

This track is awesome. Besides the story, I love how it speeds up in increments as the story builds. And there are some excellent lines:

> And all the fishes had they eyes bugged out
> 'Cause y'all dancing underwater and y'all don't get wet

There's also this:

> Ya'll remember saying how it couldn't be them two legs
> 'cause y'all came from two legs
> And y'all mamas would've loved y'all
> If they could've breathed
> But they wasn't ready for the deep

Which is just a commentary on human history and conflict: why do we keep hurting and oppressing each other when we all come from the same people?
