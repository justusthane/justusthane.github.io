I've been quite enjoying the experimental Hip Hop group *clipping.* for a while now. Also classified as *noise core*, they can be a bit difficult to get into, but I think it's worth it to give them a shot.

> I'm not a *Hamilton* guy so I didn't realize this until recently, but *clipping.*'s rapper, Daveed Diggs, played Marquis de Lafayette and Thomas Jefferson in the original production.

The first song I got into was *The Deep*, so I'll start there. It's also a pretty approachable one.
