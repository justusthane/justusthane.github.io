This poor guy is a Chinese money plant. I say "poor" because I had him at work, and I forgot about him while working from home---he went neglected for close to a month. He was *very* worse-for-wear when I finally remembered and brought him home, but luckily he seems tto be on the path to recovery. I'm hopeful!

## Update 2020-12-30

He seems to be fully recovered from my neglect and has all new leaves except for one. Beautiful and lush and green. Good job, little guy!
