<p>I haven’t had snake plants for very long, but what I have learned is that they are <em>incredibly</em> resilient and tolerant of butchery. Maybe even moreso than jades.</p>
<p><img src="IMG_5883.jpeg" alt=""><img src="IMG_5889.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>These two were originally the same plant, received from my mom. I had it sitting on a windowsill and while I was out of town for a while a few different friends stayed at my place. When I got home the snake plant had been snapped off at its stem—most of the plant was lying on the floor. I certainly don’t blame anyone—I had it in a place where it was easy to lower the window shade on top of it, which I think is what happened.</p>
<p>I was kind of sad about it and wasn’t sure what else to do, so I just stuck the snapped off portion back in the pot, and to my surprise, <em>both</em> sections lived and continued to grow—the snapped off top put down new roots, and the existing roots shot up new leaves!</p>
<p>Once I realized what was happening, I seperated them into their own pots.</p>
<p>Additionally, one of them is starting a <em>new</em> shoot!</p>
<p><img src="IMG_6066.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>I’m not sure, but I suspect that when I seperated them I damaged the roots, so some isolated roots decided to start a new plant. Amazing.</p>
<p>Before I realized that they were going to survive, I got another one from mom—and proceeded to leave the cutting out on the counter for a week before finally planting it. By then it was pretty withered, and I didn’t expect it to survive—but of course, it has.</p>
