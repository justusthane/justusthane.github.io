- Saying the alphabet backwards is easy. It goes "Z-Y-X-W-V-U-T-S-R-Q-P-O-N-M-L-K-J-I-H-G-F-E-D-C-B-A". Singing it backwards is easy too. Just sing it like you're singing it forwards, but backwards.
- Pizza is best reheated in a frying pan.
- Chances are good you're not going to die or be seriously disabled from some very-rare-but-very-terrible disease.
- Use an electric toothbrush. Your gums will thank you.
