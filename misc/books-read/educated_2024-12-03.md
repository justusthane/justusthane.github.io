An astonishing memoir of a childhood in a fundamentalist Mormon household marked by familial mental illness. Sometimes so outrageous as to be difficult to believe (and indeed, an interview with her parents shows them as much more reasonable people than as portrayed in the memoir), but I have no doubt that these sorts of things *do* happen, and I think we need to believe the author regarding her experiences. Regardless, it's an extremely compelling read.
