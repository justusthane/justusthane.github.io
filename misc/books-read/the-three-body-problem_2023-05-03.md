Beautifully written sci-fi that explores contact with extraterrestial life in a very original way. Also very interesting the way that the story is rooted in revolutionary China in the 60's. That being said, most of the interest for me was in the setup of the story and the laying out of the puzzle pieces. Once the curtain was pulled back, so to speak, and the puzzle was revealed (almost 90% of the way in), it became less interesting. The reveal felt handwavy and farfetched, even for sci-fi, and somewhat contrived to make the plot work. It also ends on a fairly abrupt note.

Regardless, I enjoyed it, it gave me something to think about, I would probably recommend it, and I will likely read the sequels.
