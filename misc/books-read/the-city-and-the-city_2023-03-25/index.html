  The City and the City

  </h1>

<p class="publish-date">Published 2023-03-25</p>
<p>Science fiction? Urban fantasy? Murder mystery? Political thriller? One of the most interesting premises I’ve read: two cities in present day central Europe superimposed on each other, occupying the same physical space, and a murder that happens in between. The first time the duality of two cities is referenced is at the end of the first chapter, in the following paragraphs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An elderly woman was walking slowly away from me in a shambling sway. She turned her head and looked at me. I was struck by her motion, and I met her eyes. I wondered if she wanted to tell me something. In my glance I took in her clotehs, her way of walking, of holding herself, and looking.</p>
<p>With a hard start, I realized that she was not on GunterStrász at all, and that I should not have seen her.</p>
<p>Immediately and flustered I looked away, and she did the same, with the same speed. I raised my head, otwards an aircraft on its final descent. When after some seconds I looked back up, unnoticing the old woman stepping heavily away, I looked carefully instead of at her in her foreign street at the facades of the nearby and local GunterStrász, that depressed zone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the book is categorized as science fiction, I assumed that this involved multiple dimensions or something, which occasionally overlapped. However, it gradually becomes evident that the actuality is somewhat more mundane, and far more interesting: it’s purely a political separation, and residents of both cities are trained from birth, implicity and explicitly, to disregard (“unsee”) the other city and all its happenings.</p>
<p>This leads to many really beautiful and fascinating passages, such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I watched the local buildings’ numbers. They rose in stuters, interspersed with foreign alter spaces. In Besźel the area was pretty unpeopled, but not elsewhere across the border, and I had to unseeing dodge many smart young businessmen and -women. Their voices were muted to me, random noise. That aural fade comes from years of Besź care. When I reached the tar-painted front where Corwi waited with an unhappy-looking man, we stood together in a near-deserted part of Besźel city, surrounded by a busy unheard throng.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I really enjoyed and respected about this book is that despite its incredibly original and complicated premise, very little is left unexplained. Almost every time I thought, “Okay, how would <em>X</em> possibly work in two superimposed cities?”, that very thing was touched on, at least in passing, within a few pages — even mundane things like garbage, utility lines, emergency vehicles, etc.</p>
<p>The plot itself wraps up in a satisfactory if not entirely stunning way, but the plot is almost secondary to the incredible worldbuilding. A book that leaves you thinking.</p>
<p>Would recommend.</p>
