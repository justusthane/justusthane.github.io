A decent thriller. Engaging and fast-paced. It's set locally to where I ~~live~~ lived, in an area that's not often written about in mainstream novels, which makes it interesting to me. It also takes place on a reservation and depicts the Native American characters in a clear-eyed and sensitive way. However, the characters are flat and predictable, and often perform actions that don't make sense and are clearly designed only to move the plot along, a device which drives me crazy, since it makes it feel like the characters aren't freewilled people. 

Worth reading once.
