A family drama told through the eyes of the dog â€” although not in the predictable, schmaltzy way you might expect. 

This book has been haunting me for years. I initially picked it up at a friend's house and read the first couple pages and was immediately caught, but didn't make a huge effort to seek it out later. When I finally did, I couldn't put it down until I was done. Just beautful. Perfectly captures the human condition.
