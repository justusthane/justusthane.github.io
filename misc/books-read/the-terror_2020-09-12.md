Historical fiction about the doomed Franklin expedition to find the northwest passage, this 770-page book spends most of its length chronicaling the tribulations of the men trapped on the ice, facing hypothermia, starvation, scurvy, madness---while also being stalked and picked off by an unknown monster on the ice. The first 600+ pages can, at times, feel like it's not going anywhere---more starvation, more men dying, hopelessness continues---but still manages to remain engaging. The writing at times feels sloppy, with contradictions only a couple of sentances apart. 

In the last one hundred pages it becomes an almost entirely different novel, in a rather jarring but good way.

Overall, I enjoyed it. Worth reading.
