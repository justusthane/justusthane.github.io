## 2022-03-22 - The Beginning
I've never been much of a runner, despite Caroline doing her best to get me to run with her. When I've run with 4-10k distances with her I've struggled to keep up, and when I've run by myself I've always ended even short runs panting and exhausted, thinking I always had to run as fast as possible to make it count. The only race I'd run was a half-marathon trail relay at Kamview a few years ago (2017?) of which I ran 4.3 miles while Caroline did the remaining two thirds. I managed to match Caroline's pace and enjoyed the competition, but still felt destroyed by it.

My longest run to date was [16.4k](https://www.strava.com/activities/6724316888), which I ran on a whim last spring, and while I enjoyed it, again I was toast by the end and it put me off running again.

Something changed when I started running this winter after Caroline talked me into running The Hoot series of trail races. I'm not sure if it was winter running, or running with Caroline and Madeline at a slower pace, but something finally taught me that it's okay to start slow. I also fell in love with winter running. The cold, the snow, the quiet, the lack of humidity. It's wonderful.

Although I found races difficult---especially the Hoot 5, which with the deep snow and steep hills was grueling---something had shifted and I enjoyed the challenege more than before.
