  <h1>I fell in love with the cashier at Kohl&#39;s</h1>

<p class="publish-date">Published 2014-08-31</p>
<p>Standing in line at Kohl’s, I was intrigued by the cashier as she checked out the woman ahead of us in line. I couldn’t read her. I couldn’t tell if she was content or tired. I couldn’t tell if she was exasperated with the woman, or patient. She was tiny and very pregnant. She seemed to take a long time to check the woman out.</p>
<p>She wasn’t paying attention when I stepped to the register, doing something else. I carefully laid out my tie, suspenders, and belt on the counter, all with their barcodes facing up, facing towards her.</p>
<p>Finally, she looked at the counter, looked up, surprised. “Did you lay those all out for me?”</p>
<p>I nodded. “I was going to do the same with the shirt and the pants, but…”</p>
<p>“You’re slacking?” She smiled, scanning my items. “Do you want to sign up for a Kohl’s charge card? 20% off your entire order.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“You sure? You can pay off the first charge now.”</p>
<p>“Not interested.”</p>
<p>Shrugged, finished ringing me up. Looked at me. “I’m going to give you 20% off anyway, because you’re <em>sort of</em> nice.”</p>
<p>She circled something on my receipt. “You saved $77.79 shopping at Kohl’s…that’s a funny number.” She handed it to me, her hand brushing mine.</p>
<p>She was small. Pregnant. Tired. Radiant. I wanted to ask her when she was due; if it was a boy or a girl. If it had a name yet. If it was her first. I didn’t. We left. It was a simple encounter, but I kept thinking about it on my drive home.</p>
<p>I’m reminded of an interview I heard a couple of months ago on To the Best of our Knowledge with Barbara Fredrickson, author of <em>Love 2.0</em>.</p>
<p>She redefines love in a beautiful way; not as a static entity but instead as moments of connection with others, whether with your soul mate, best friend, a stranger on the street, or a cashier at Kohl’s. From that interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Love is that moment of connection that you feel when you look into someone’s eyes, you’re feeling the same way and you momentarily have a sense of mutual concern for one another.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I see these micro moments of connection as being the real heart of a broader love system and they’re the actionable pieces.  You can actually decide, ‘I want to feel more connected with people today,’ and make a change in how you interact with people and achieve that, whereas if you say, 'Well I want more love relationships today, that’s going to be be tougher to act on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love these brief moments of connection that linger on, whether it’s an unexpected smile, an uplifting exchange in a checkout line, or a square dance shared with a partner who is on the same wavelength. I live for them.</p>
